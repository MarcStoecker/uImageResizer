_uImageResizer is making it quick and easy to integrate ImageResizer.Net with any Umbraco website._

### Installation

### Licensing

The core and 18 plugins are free and open-source, under a modified MIT license called the [Freedom licence](http://imageresizing.net/licenses/freedom). 

The following DLLs are under the Freedom license:

* ImageResizer.dll
* ImageResizer.Mvc.dll
* ImageResizer.Plugins.Logging.dll

The free trial license permits use of the paid plugins for development and testing purposes, but not for production use. Once you begin using them on a production server, you will need a Pro or Enterprise-wide license.
